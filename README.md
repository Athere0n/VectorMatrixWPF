# VectorMatrixWPF

A GUI app to improve my knowledge of linear algebra.

Allows the user to:
  - add vectors, either manually or randomly
  - transform the plane
    - displays a static grid showing the initial state and a dynamic grid showing the changed state
  - animate the transformations
  - undo transformations step by step
  
Some features to be added later are:
  - display each transformation (start and end state) in the right window
    - from this, allow the user to go back to a specific state by clicking on it
  - allow the user to delete vectors
  - add ability to display the determinant
  
A MUCH later goal is to include a 3D version
